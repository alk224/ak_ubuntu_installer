<p>   <a href="http://vicerveza.homeunix.net/~viric/soft/ts/">Task spooler</a> is a command queue that allows you to line jobs up on your computer. This is useful if you are running multiple jobs that are very resource-intensive because you can control how many resources are being consumed at a time.</p>
<p>   Essential commands to know:</p>
<ul><li>ts (main queue)</li>
<li>ts -c (print std_out from currently running job on ts queue)</li>
<li>ts -L xxx (name a job, where xxx is the name with no spaces)</li>
<li>ts -m (email results of job upon completion)</li>
<li>ts -C (clear the list of completed jobs in ts queue)</li>
<li>ts -K (kill the ts queue)</li>
<li>ts -S # (change the number of jobs allowed to run in the ts queue, where # is an integer)</li>
</ul>
<p>   That may be how you control a queue, but I find it more useful to split my jobs between the two additional queues I set up. You control these just like the ts queue, but the commands instead are <strong>tslight</strong> and <strong>tsheavy</strong>. For example, on my 24-core computer I would line up a bunch of OTU picking jobs set to consume 16 cores on the heavy queue which allows only a single job to process at a time, while I might put a bunch of alignment, tree building and/or core diversity jobs on the light queue (3 simultaneous jobs) to consume only 4 cores at a time. Since many of these less-consumptive jobs only need all the cores part of the time, you can likely get away with the 3 simultaneous jobs most of the time.</p>
<h3>tslight or tsheavy queues</h3>
<ul><li>tslight (queue #1, default allows three simultaneous jobs)</li>
<li>tsheavy (queue #2, default allows a single job at a time)</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="heading1">Examples </h2>
<p>Pick OTUs command to heavy queue, naming the job "otu_picking_16S" and emailing the results of the job to the user:</p>
<pre>tsheavy -m -L otu_picking_16S otu_picking_workflow.sh ./ 16S</pre>
<p>Alignment and tree command with name and email to light queue:</p>
<pre>tslight -m -L align_swarm_d1 align_and_tree_workflow.sh swarm_otus_d1/ 16S</pre>
<p>Check status of job running in light queue:</p>
<pre>tslight -c</pre>
<p>Clear completed jobs in heavy queue:</p>
<pre>tsheavy -C</pre>
