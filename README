This is a script meant to ease rebuilding of my bioinformatics
computer when (not if) the system drive fails.  It also facilitates
establishing a new cloud instance (say on EC2 or iPLANT) or if
you wish to set up a VM in some other environment.

***** REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS TO WORK *****

1) Functioning Ubuntu install (tested only on 14.04 LTS)
2) All updates in place

Probably best for a fresh install.  If you have some other verison
of python or other dependencies already in place, this might not
work very well, or it could work fine and wreck something else
dear to you instead.  If your system has an Nvidia graphics card,
make sure to enable the proprietary drivers before you start the
installer.

sudo apt-get -yfm upgrade
