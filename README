This is a script meant to ease rebuilding of my bioinformatics
computer when (not if) the system drive fails.  It also facilitates
establishing a new cloud instance (say on EC2 or iPLANT) or if
you wish to set up a VM in some other environment.

***** REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS TO WORK *****

1) Functioning Ubuntu install (tested only on 14.04 LTS)
2) All updates in place

Probably best for a fresh install.  If you have some other verison
of python or other dependencies already in place, this might not
work very well.

***** INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS *****

Issue the following commands:

cd
sudo apt-get install git
https://github.com/alk224/akutils_ubuntu_installer.gitsudo ./ak_ubuntu_installer/ak_ubuntu_installation.sh install
***** OTHER FUNCTIONS *****
./ak_ubuntu_installer/ak_ubuntu_installation.sh (print help screen)
./ak_ubuntu_installer/ak_ubuntu_installation.sh list (list of software to be installed)
